# ft_irc
The goal of this project is to create an IRC server that should work with the client of our choice. We used [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/) as a reference client. We have also used [RFC2812](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2812.txt) as a basis.

The server is compatible on MacOS and Linux only.
